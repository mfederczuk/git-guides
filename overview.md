This document describes several guidelines, best practices, conventions and
 rules on how to use **Git** in my repositories.

These guidelines are nothing new, most of what is written here is copied over or
 is based off of  other best practices and conventions that already exists.

I also do not completely enforce these guidelines, but it is better to follow
 them so that everything stays consistent with one another.
